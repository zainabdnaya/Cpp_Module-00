# Class && Constructor && destructor

When you define a <strong>class </strong> , you define a blueprint for a data type.
A class constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.
A constructor will have exact same name as the class and it does not have any return type at all, not even void. 
Constructors can be very useful for setting initial values for certain member variables.

A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed 
whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete 
expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.
