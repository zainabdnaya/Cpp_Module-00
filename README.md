    cin: Standard input stream (object )
    cout: Standard output stream (object )

# Class && Constructor && destructor

    When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type.

    A class constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.
    A constructor will have exact same name as the class and it does not have any return type at all, not even void. 
    C onstructors can be very useful for setting initial values for certain member variables.

    A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed 
    whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete 
    expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

# Class VS Struct in C++

 The only difference between a struct and class in C++ is the default accessibility 
 of member variables and methods. 
 In a struct they are public; in a class they are private.
